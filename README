TOS Porting System
the first time you use this system, you should do the following:
. build/envsetup.sh
make create device=aosp
make create device=tos
make config device=aosp
make config device=tos
cd devices/aosp
(link aosp ota package to devices/aosp/ota.zip)
(link aosp source directory to devices/aosp/source)
make prepare
cd devices/tos
(link tos ota package to devices/tos/ota.zip)
(link tos source directory to devices/tos/source)
make prepare

when you want port to a device such as i9500, do the following:
. build/envsetup.sh
make create device=i9500
make config device=i9500
cd devices/i9500
(link i9500 ota package to devices/i9500/ota.zip)
make prepare
make patch
(solve smali patch conflicts)
(if you want to do patch based on java sources, execute 'make javapath')
make repack
make package
